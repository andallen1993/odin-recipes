        <h4>This <em style="color: red;">lasagna</em> recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and 
            filling that it's worth it!</h4>
        <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe more than 
            20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our 
            top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more 
            than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna 
            recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly 
            passed away at 53 years old â€” read all about his life and legacy here.</p>
